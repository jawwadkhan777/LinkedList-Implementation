# Linked List Data Structure in Java

This repository contains the implementation of the Linked List data structure in Java. The Linked List is a fundamental data structure in computer science, providing a dynamic way to store and manage a sequence of elements.

## Project Overview ðŸ“š

As part of my ongoing journey in learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java, I have implemented the Linked List data structure. This project is a practical application of the concepts I have learned through YouTube tutorials and hands-on coding in IntelliJ IDEA.

### Linked List
- **Description:** A Linked List is a linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next, forming a sequence. Unlike arrays, Linked Lists are dynamic, allowing for efficient insertions and deletions.
- **Types Implemented:**
  - **Singly Linked List:** Each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
  - **Doubly Linked List:** Each node contains data, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node.
  - **Circular Linked List:** The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.

### Key Features
- **Insertion:** Adding elements at the beginning, end, or specific position.
- **Deletion:** Removing elements from the beginning, end, or specific position.
- **Traversal:** Iterating through the list to access elements.
- **Search:** Finding an element within the list.

## Get Started ðŸš€

To get started with this project, simply clone this repository and open the desired Linked List implementation file in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA). No additional setup is required!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jawwadkhan777/LinkedList-Implementation.git
```
